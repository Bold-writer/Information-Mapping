You can use this software on any machine that has a minimum of 100 mb hard drive space, 100 gb RAM or greater, and is running Intel 3.0GHz or more. You must also have Word and Excel because they are the systems used for the generation of output such as reports and parts lists from Factory Monitor. The types of people who will be users for this software are the Project engineers and System Integrators. Users can get started with the system in four steps. First, they have to install the software that’s on the CD. Then they need to open the software and do the configuration of the system settings. This step includes things like giving users rights to the variety of different parts of the system. There is a default user which is the system administrator. Remember that the passwords for the system have to be eight characters in length or more and they should have some special characters. After that, users need to set up the system to monitor which kinds of situations or conditions they want to keep track of. Some examples of these things is a tank over filling and triggering an alarm. Another example is a valve that does not open properly and causes an alarm. Once users have this in place, they can figure out what they want the alarm to say when it is triggered. This is useful because you can give instructions to the people on the plant floor about how to remediate the problem.
